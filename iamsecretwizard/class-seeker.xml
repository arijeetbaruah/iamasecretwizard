            <p>Seekers are explorers and live to dig, delve, dive, and discover. They have the tools to find new clues constantly, with divination magic and broad access to investigation skills. But they are also versatile, able to pick up any one skill as they need to fulfill their goals.</p>
            <h4>Cunning Warriors</h4>
            <p>While some combatants use speed, subterfuge or savagery to get the upper hand in battle, seekers rely on their analytical skills to predict the attacks of their enemies or to detect their weak spots.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>CREATING A Seeker</h4>
            <p>When you create a seeker, first consider what is the type of mystery your character would want to solve. Is your character an archaeologist, attempting to recover ancient artifacts of untold power? Perhaps your character is more of an investigator, following clues to catch their mark. Or maybe what your character is really interested in is accumulating knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself – or the power that knowledge bestows.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a seeker quickly following these suggestions. Make Strength your highest ability score, and Intelligence your second highest. Then, choose the investigator background.</p>
            <h2>CLASS FEATURES</h2>
            <p>As an Seeker, you gain the following class features.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">HIT POINTS</h5>

                <li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Seeker level after 1st</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Starting at 10th level, you have access to a special ritual that allows you to store a creature's memory into an object or show a stored memory to others. After spending 1 minute while a coin is within your reach, a willing creature may touch the object to store one of its memories into it, at the creature's choice. Even if the creature is uncertain about the full details of that memory, storing the memory this way imparts all the details as far as that creature was aware of at the time. An object can only store one memory at the time, and the memory cannot span a period of time longer than 1 hour. After a creature stores a memory this way, if the creature is willing, that creature may also erase that specific memory from its mind.</p>
            <p class="indent">After this is done, you may select a command word. When a creature touches the object and speaks that word, that creature witnesses the memory as it was stored. This an immediate effect that takes no time.</p>
